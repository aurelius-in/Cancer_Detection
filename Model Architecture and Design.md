# Model Architecture and Design

## Model Selection

The model for this project will be a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) due to its ability to classify images with high accuracy. Specifically, we will use a pre-trained CNN architecture such as VGG-16 or ResNet-50 as a feature extractor, followed by a few fully connected layers to classify the images.

## Model Architecture

The model architecture will consist of the following layers:

1. Preprocessing Layer: Normalize the pixel values and apply image augmentation techniques to the input images.
2. Feature Extraction Layer: Use a pre-trained CNN architecture (e.g., VGG-16 or ResNet-50) to extract features from the input images.
3. Classification Layer: Use one or more fully connected layers to classify the images into benign or malignant diagnoses.

## Training Plan

The model will be trained using the following steps:

1. Divide the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
2. Initialize the pre-trained CNN architecture with its pre-trained weights.
3. Freeze the layers of the pre-trained CNN architecture to prevent them from being retrained.
4. Train the fully connected layers using the training set and the frozen pre-trained CNN architecture.
5. Validate the model's performance using the validation set.
6. Fine-tune the model by unfreezing some of the layers of the pre-trained CNN architecture and training them along with the fully connected layers.
7. Evaluate the model's performance using the test set.

## Hyperparameter Tuning

The following hyperparameters will be tuned during the training process to optimize the model's performance:

- Learning Rate: The rate at which the model adjusts its weights during training.
- Dropout Rate: The percentage of neurons to randomly drop out during training to prevent overfitting.
- Batch Size: The number of images used in each batch during training.
- Number of Epochs: The number of times the entire training set is used to train the model.

## Conclusion

This model architecture and design document outlines the CNN-based architecture for skin cancer image classification. It includes a pre-processing layer, a feature extraction layer based on a pre-trained CNN architecture, and a classification layer. The model will be trained using a training, validation, and test set, and hyperparameter tuning will be performed to optimize its performance.

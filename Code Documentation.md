## Function Descriptions

### data_preprocessing.py

- `load_data()`: Load the skin cancer image dataset from disk and split it into training, validation, and test sets.
- `augment_data()`: Apply data augmentation techniques such as rotation, flipping, and shifting to increase the number of training samples.
- `resize_and_normalize()`: Resize the images to a fixed size and normalize their pixel values.

### model.py

- `build_model()`: Build the skin cancer image classification model using a pre-trained CNN architecture with its pre-trained weights and a fully connected layer.
- `train_model()`: Train the skin cancer image classification model using the training and validation sets, and save the best model weights based on the validation loss.
- `fine_tune_model()`: Fine-tune the skin cancer image classification model by unfreezing some of the layers of the pre-trained CNN architecture and training them along with the fully connected layer.

### evaluation.py

- `calculate_accuracy()`: Calculate the accuracy of the model's predictions.
- `calculate_precision()`: Calculate the precision of the model's predictions.
- `calculate_recall()`: Calculate the recall of the model's predictions.

- `calculate_auc_roc()`: Calculate the AUC-ROC of the model's predictions.

### testing.py

- `load_model()`: Load the trained skin cancer image classification model with its weights.
- `generate_predictions()`: Generate predictions for the skin cancer image test set using the loaded model.
- `calculate_evaluation_metrics()`: Calculate the evaluation metrics for the predictions using the ground truth labels.
- `visualize_predictions()`: Visualize the predictions using sample images from the test set and their corresponding predicted labels.

### main.py

- `main()`: The main function that runs the entire skin cancer image classification pipeline, including data preprocessing, model training, model evaluation, and model testing.

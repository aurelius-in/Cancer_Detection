# Project Proposal: Image Recognition for Skin Cancer Detection

## Overview

Skin cancer is a prevalent form of cancer, with approximately 9,500 people diagnosed every day worldwide. Early detection of skin cancer is critical for successful treatment and improved patient outcomes. This project aims to develop an AI-based Image Recognition for Skin Cancer Detection system to help dermatologists identify signs of skin cancer in medical images.

## Project Goals

The primary goals of this project are to:

1. Develop a deep learning model to detect signs of cancer in medical images.

2. Achieve high accuracy in identifying malignant and benign skin lesions.

3. Deploy the model as a web application for users to upload images and receive predictions.

## Project Objectives

To achieve the project goals, the following objectives must be met:

1. Collect a large dataset of medical images of different types of skin lesions, including benign and malignant lesions.

2. Preprocess the data to prepare it for training, including image resizing, normalization, and cropping.

3. Augment the images to increase the size of the dataset and improve the model's ability to generalize.

4. Train a deep learning model, such as a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), to detect skin lesions. Fine-tune a pre-trained model to learn to detect features that distinguish benign from malignant skin lesions.

5. Optimize the model hyperparameters to improve the accuracy of the model.

6. Evaluate the performance of the model on a test dataset using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Test the model's ability to generalize by evaluating it on new, unseen data.

7. Deploy the model as a web application or API to enable users to upload images and receive predictions.

## Expected Outcomes

The expected outcomes of the project are:

1. A deep learning model that can accurately detect signs of skin cancer in medical images.

2. A web application or API that allows users to upload images and receive predictions about whether a lesion is benign or malignant.

3. A technical report describing the project's methodology, results, and limitations.

## Conclusion

This project aims to develop an AI-based Image Recognition for Skin Cancer Detection system to improve early detection of skin cancer and improve patient outcomes. The project will involve data preprocessing, image augmentation, model training, and hyperparameter tuning. The expected outcomes of the project are a deep learning model that can accurately detect signs of skin cancer in medical images and a web application or API that allows users to upload images and receive predictions.

# Model Testing Plan

## Testing Process

The model will be tested using the following steps:

1. Load the trained model with its weights.
2. Load the test dataset.
3. Generate predictions for the test dataset using the loaded model.
4. Calculate the evaluation metrics for the predictions using the ground truth labels.
5. Visualize the predictions using sample images from the test dataset and their corresponding predicted labels.

## Evaluation Metrics

The following evaluation metrics will be used to measure the performance of the model during testing:

- Accuracy: The percentage of correct predictions made by the model.
- Precision: The proportion of positive predictions that are correct.
- Recall: The proportion of actual positive cases that are correctly identified.
- F1-Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
- AUC-ROC: The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.

## Conclusion

This model testing plan outlines the steps for testing the skin cancer image classification model. It includes the loading of the trained model and test dataset, the generation of predictions, the calculation of evaluation metrics, and the visualization of predictions using sample images. The evaluation metrics used to measure the performance of the model during testing include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.

# Model Training and Evaluation Plan

## Training Process

The model will be trained using the following steps:

1. Divide the dataset into training, validation, and test sets using an 80-10-10 split.
2. Load the pre-trained CNN architecture (e.g., VGG-16 or ResNet-50) with its pre-trained weights.
3. Freeze the layers of the pre-trained CNN architecture to prevent them from being retrained.
4. Train the fully connected layers using the training set and the frozen pre-trained CNN architecture.
5. Validate the model's performance using the validation set.
6. Fine-tune the model by unfreezing some of the layers of the pre-trained CNN architecture and training them along with the fully connected layers.
7. Evaluate the model's performance using the test set.

## Evaluation Metrics

The following evaluation metrics will be used to measure the performance of the model:

- Accuracy: The percentage of correct predictions made by the model.
- Precision: The proportion of positive predictions that are correct.
- Recall: The proportion of actual positive cases that are correctly identified.
- F1-Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
- AUC-ROC: The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.

## Hyperparameter Tuning

The following hyperparameters will be tuned during the training process to optimize the model's performance:

- Learning Rate: The rate at which the model adjusts its weights during training.
- Dropout Rate: The percentage of neurons to randomly drop out during training to prevent overfitting.
- Batch Size: The number of images used in each batch during training.
- Number of Epochs: The number of times the entire training set is used to train the model.

## Conclusion

This model training and evaluation plan outlines the steps for training and evaluating the skin cancer image classification model. It includes a training process with a division of the dataset into training, validation, and test sets, and the use of pre-trained CNN architecture with its pre-trained weights. The evaluation metrics used to measure the performance of the model include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC, and hyperparameter tuning will be performed to optimize its performance.
